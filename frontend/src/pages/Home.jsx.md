### Overview

This React component (`Home`) is responsible for displaying the homepage of a DALL-E AI-generated image showcase. The component fetches data from the backend API, allows users to search posts, and displays results in a grid layout.

### Components

The component utilizes the following custom components:

- **`Card`**: Displays individual image posts.
- **`Loader`**: Shows a loading spinner while data is being fetched.
- **`FormField`**: Creates a reusable search input field.

### State

The `Home` component manages the following state variables:

| Variable | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `loading` | Indicates whether the data is being fetched. | `boolean` |
| `allPosts` | Array of all image posts fetched from the API. | `array` |
| `searchText` | Text entered in the search field. | `string` |
| `searchedResults` | Array of image posts matching the search criteria. | `array` |
| `searchTimeout` | Timer to control search debouncing. | `number` |

### Functions

The `Home` component uses the following functions:

- **`fetchPosts()`**: Fetches image posts from the backend API.
    - Sets `loading` to `true` before fetching.
    - Makes a `GET` request to the API endpoint (`https://openaitexttoimage.onrender.com/api/v1/post`).
    - If the request is successful, retrieves the data, reverses the order of posts, and sets `allPosts`.
    - Sets `loading` to `false` after fetching.
    - Handles potential errors by alerting the user.
- **`handleSearchChange(e)`**: Handles changes in the search input field.
    - Clears any existing search timeout.
    - Updates `searchText` with the value from the input field.
    - Sets a new timeout using `setTimeout`, which will be used to debounce search requests.
    - Inside the timeout callback:
        - Filters `allPosts` based on `searchText`.
        - Sets `searchedResults` with the filtered results.

### Rendering

The `Home` component renders the following structure:

1. **Header:** Displays a title and description of the image showcase.
2. **Search Bar:** Includes a `FormField` component for search input, using `handleSearchChange` to update state.
3. **Content:**
    - Shows a `Loader` while data is being fetched.
    - If search text is present:
        - Displays a message indicating the search results.
        - Renders a grid of image posts using `RenderCards` with `searchedResults`.
    - Otherwise:
        - Renders a grid of image posts using `RenderCards` with `allPosts`.

**Notes:**

- The `RenderCards` component is used to display a grid of image posts.
- The `Card` component displays individual image posts.
- The `FormField` component provides a reusable search input field.
- The `Loader` component shows a loading spinner while data is being fetched.
- The `fetchPosts` function fetches data from the API and updates the `allPosts` state.
- The `handleSearchChange` function handles changes in the search input and updates the `searchText` state.
- Search debouncing is implemented using `setTimeout` to prevent excessive API calls during rapid typing.
- The component displays a message if no search results are found or if no posts are available.
- The component uses a responsive grid layout to display image posts effectively on different screen sizes.
- The component is styled using CSS to provide a visually appealing user experience.
